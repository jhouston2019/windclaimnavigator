<h2>What Happens When You Miss a Deadline</h2>
<p style="text-align: center; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto 2rem;">Missing an insurance claim deadline can have serious consequences, but the outcome depends on which deadline you missed and why. Not all missed deadlines are fatal to your claim.</p>

<div style="max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">
<h3>Missed Notice of Loss Deadline</h3>
<p>This is one of the most serious deadlines. Most policies require "prompt" or "immediate" notice of loss. However, insurance companies rarely deny claims solely for late notice unless the delay prejudiced their ability to investigate. If you missed this deadline, file your claim immediately and explain the delay.</p>

<h3>Missed Proof of Loss Deadline</h3>
<p>Proof of loss deadlines are typically more flexible than notice deadlines. Many insurers will accept late proof of loss if you have a reasonable explanation. Submit your proof of loss with a letter explaining the delay.</p>

<h3>Missed Appeal Deadline</h3>
<p>Appeal deadlines are often strictly enforced. However, some policies allow multiple levels of appeal. If you missed the first appeal deadline, check whether you can still file a second-level appeal or request external review.</p>

<h3>Missed Recoverable Depreciation Deadline</h3>
<p>These deadlines are typically firm. Once the deadline passes, you forfeit the recoverable depreciation. However, if the insurance company caused the delay, you may be able to argue for an extension.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<div style="max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">
<div class="tool-card">
<h3>Can my claim be denied just for missing a deadline?</h3>
<p>It depends on the deadline and your policy. Notice of loss deadlines are taken seriously, but insurers must typically show they were prejudiced by the delay. Other deadlines may be more flexible.</p>
</div>

<div class="tool-card">
<h3>What's a good reason for missing a deadline?</h3>
<p>Serious illness, hospitalization, military deployment, natural disasters, or insurer-caused delays are generally considered valid reasons. "I forgot" or "I was busy" are not.</p>
</div>

<div class="tool-card">
<h3>Can I sue if my claim is denied for a missed deadline?</h3>
<p>Yes, but success depends on whether the deadline was properly communicated, whether you had a valid excuse, and whether the insurer was prejudiced by the delay.</p>
</div>

<div class="tool-card">
<h3>What if the insurance company never told me about the deadline?</h3>
<p>If the insurer failed to properly communicate deadlines, they may be estopped from enforcing them. Document this failure and argue for an extension.</p>
</div>

<div class="tool-card">
<h3>Is it worth trying to recover a claim after missing a deadline?</h3>
<p>Yes. Many "missed" deadlines can be overcome with proper explanation and documentation. Don't give up without trying.</p>
