<h2>Common Roof Claim Challenges</h2>
<p style="text-align: center; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto 2rem;">Roof insurance claims are heavily disputed. Insurance companies look for any reason to deny roof replacement or apply massive depreciation to reduce payouts.</p>

<div style="max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">
<h3>Age and Condition Disputes</h3>
<p>Insurance adjusters argue that roof damage is due to age and wear rather than covered storm damage. They'll point to any sign of aging—granule loss, curling shingles, or previous repairs—as evidence the roof was already failing. This allows them to deny claims or apply heavy depreciation.</p>

<h3>Aggressive Depreciation</h3>
<p>Roof depreciation is calculated based on age and expected lifespan. A 15-year-old roof with a 20-year lifespan might be depreciated 75%, leaving you with only 25% of replacement cost upfront. If you have replacement cost coverage, you can recover depreciation after repairs, but many homeowners don't understand this.</p>

<h3>Cosmetic Damage Exclusions</h3>
<p>Some policies exclude coverage for cosmetic damage that doesn't affect functionality. Insurance companies use this to deny hail damage claims, arguing that dented shingles are cosmetic. However, hail damage compromises shingle integrity even if the roof doesn't currently leak.</p>

<h3>Matching Issues</h3>
<p>If only part of your roof is damaged, insurance may only pay for that section. Finding matching shingles for a discontinued product is often impossible, but insurers resist paying for full roof replacement when they can't match.</p>

<h2>How to Document Roof Claims</h2>
<p style="text-align: center; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto 2rem;">Proper documentation proves your roof damage was caused by a covered event, not age or maintenance issues.</p>

<div style="max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Document Pre-Storm Condition</strong> — If possible, have photos showing roof condition before the storm</li>
<li><strong>Photograph All Damage</strong> — Take close-up photos of damaged shingles, dents, cracks, and missing granules</li>
<li><strong>Document the Storm</strong> — Get weather reports showing wind speeds or hail size in your area</li>
<li><strong>Get Multiple Contractor Estimates</strong> — Roofing contractors, not general contractors</li>
<li><strong>Request Detailed Scope</strong> — Ensure estimates specify all damaged areas and necessary repairs</li>
<li><strong>Challenge Age Arguments</strong> — If your roof was well-maintained, get contractor statements confirming it was in good condition before the storm</li>
<li><strong>Understand Depreciation</strong> — Know whether you have actual cash value or replacement cost coverage</li>
<li><strong>Document Matching Issues</strong> — If shingles can't be matched, get written confirmation from manufacturers</li>
<li><strong>Get Engineering Reports</strong> — For disputed claims, engineering assessments can prove storm damage</li>
<li><strong>Review Code Upgrade Requirements</strong> — Building code changes may require upgrades that increase costs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<div style="max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">
<div class="tool-card">
<h3>Will insurance replace my entire roof or just damaged sections?</h3>
<p>It depends on the extent of damage and your policy. If damage is widespread or matching is impossible, full replacement may be covered. If damage is limited, insurers typically only pay for affected sections.</p>
</div>

<div class="tool-card">
<h3>How much depreciation will be applied to my roof claim?</h3>
<p>Depreciation is typically calculated based on age divided by expected lifespan. A 10-year-old roof with a 20-year lifespan would be depreciated 50%.</p>
</div>

<div class="tool-card">
<h3>What if my roof is old but the damage is from a recent storm?</h3>
<p>Age doesn't automatically disqualify coverage. If storm damage is documented, it should be covered. However, expect the insurer to apply significant depreciation.</p>
</div>

<div class="tool-card">
<h3>Can I upgrade to better shingles and have insurance pay the difference?</h3>
<p>Insurance pays for "like kind and quality" replacement. Upgrades are typically your responsibility, though you can use your settlement toward upgraded materials.</p>
</div>

<div class="tool-card">
<h3>What if the adjuster says my roof damage is cosmetic?</h3>
<p>Challenge this with contractor and engineering opinions. Hail damage, even if not currently leaking, compromises shingle integrity and reduces roof lifespan.</p>
