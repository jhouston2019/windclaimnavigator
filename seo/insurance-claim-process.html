<h2>The Seven Stages of Insurance Claims</h2>
<p style="text-align: center; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto 2rem;">Understanding the claim process helps you know what to expect, when to act, and how to avoid common pitfalls at each stage.</p>

<div style="max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">
<h3>Stage 1: Damage Occurs and Initial Response</h3>
<p>Damage happens. Your first priority is safety and preventing further damage. Take emergency measures like tarping roofs or shutting off water. Document everything immediately with photos and videos. Contact your insurance company within 24-48 hours.</p>

<h3>Stage 2: Claim Filing and Assignment</h3>
<p>You file a formal claim with your insurance company. They assign a claim number and adjuster. You'll receive contact information and initial instructions. This typically happens within 2-3 days of reporting damage.</p>

<h3>Stage 3: Investigation and Inspection</h3>
<p>The adjuster schedules an inspection, typically within 7-10 days. They examine damage, take photos, and ask questions about causation. Be present for this inspection and point out all damage. The adjuster will also review your policy to determine coverage.</p>

<h3>Stage 4: Evaluation and Initial Offer</h3>
<p>The adjuster prepares an estimate and the insurance company makes an initial settlement offer. This usually arrives 2-3 weeks after inspection. The initial offer is almost always negotiable and often significantly lower than fair value.</p>

<h3>Stage 5: Negotiation</h3>
<p>You review the offer, obtain contractor estimates, and negotiate for a fair settlement. This phase involves back-and-forth communication, submission of additional documentation, and potentially re-inspections. Negotiation can take 2-6 weeks.</p>

<h3>Stage 6: Settlement or Dispute Resolution</h3>
<p>Either you reach agreement and receive payment, or you move to formal dispute resolution through appeals, appraisal, mediation, or litigation.</p>

<h3>Stage 7: Repairs and Recoverable Depreciation</h3>
<p>You complete repairs and, if applicable, submit documentation to recover depreciation holdback. This final payment typically comes within 30 days of submitting repair invoices.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<div style="max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">
<div class="tool-card">
<h3>Can I handle the claim process myself or do I need professional help?</h3>
<p>Most homeowners can successfully handle property claims with proper guidance and tools. Professional help (public adjusters or attorneys) is typically only necessary for very large or complex claims.</p>
</div>

<div class="tool-card">
<h3>What's the most important stage of the process?</h3>
<p>Documentation in the first 48 hours is critical. Poor initial documentation weakens your entire claim. The negotiation stage is also crucial—this is where most money is won or lost.</p>
</div>

<div class="tool-card">
<h3>Can I skip stages or speed up the process?</h3>
<p>You can't skip required stages, but you can accelerate the process by being responsive, organized, and proactive.</p>
</div>

<div class="tool-card">
<h3>What if my claim doesn't follow this process?</h3>
<p>Every claim is unique. This is a general framework. Your specific claim may have additional steps or different timing depending on complexity and your insurer's procedures.</p>
</div>

<div class="tool-card">
<h3>When should I get professional help?</h3>
<p>Consider professional help if your claim is denied, involves complex coverage issues, exceeds $100,000, or if you're not comfortable negotiating.</p>
