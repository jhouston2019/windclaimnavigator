<h2>Temporary Housing Coverage</h2>
<p style="text-align: center; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto 2rem;">When your home is uninhabitable due to covered damage, your insurance policy's Additional Living Expenses (ALE) coverage pays for temporary housing. Understanding what's covered and how to claim these expenses ensures you're properly compensated.</p>

<div style="max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">
<h3>What Temporary Housing Costs Are Covered</h3>
<p>Insurance covers the increased cost of temporary housing compared to your normal housing expenses. If you normally pay $1,500/month for housing but pay $3,000/month for a rental, insurance covers the $1,500 difference. This includes hotels, short-term rentals, extended stay hotels, or temporary apartments.</p>

<h3>Choosing Temporary Housing</h3>
<p>You must choose "reasonable and comparable" housing. This means housing similar in quality, size, and location to your home. A luxury hotel when you live in a modest home may not be covered. However, you're not required to choose the cheapest option—comparable quality is the standard.</p>

<h3>Coverage Duration</h3>
<p>Temporary housing coverage continues until your home is repaired enough to be habitable, subject to policy limits. Insurance companies often dispute when your home becomes habitable, trying to cut off coverage before repairs are complete.</p>

<h3>Coverage Limits</h3>
<p>Most policies limit temporary housing to 20-30% of dwelling coverage or 12-24 months. If you have $300,000 dwelling coverage with 20% ALE, you have up to $60,000 for all additional living expenses including temporary housing. Track your spending carefully.</p>

<h2>How to Claim Temporary Housing Costs</h2>
<p style="text-align: center; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto 2rem;">Proper documentation and timely claims ensure you're reimbursed for all temporary housing expenses.</p>

<div style="max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Notify Your Insurer Immediately</strong> — Report that you need temporary housing before incurring expenses</li>
<li><strong>Get Pre-Approval</strong> — Confirm your housing choice is acceptable before committing to long-term rentals</li>
<li><strong>Keep All Receipts</strong> — Save every hotel bill, rental agreement, and payment receipt</li>
<li><strong>Document Normal Housing Costs</strong> — Show what you normally pay for housing (mortgage, rent, utilities)</li>
<li><strong>Choose Comparable Housing</strong> — Select housing similar in quality and location to your home</li>
<li><strong>Submit Claims Regularly</strong> — File monthly rather than waiting until the end</li>
<li><strong>Track Against Limits</strong> — Monitor your spending against policy limits</li>
<li><strong>Consider Cost-Effectiveness</strong> — Extended stay hotels or rentals may be cheaper than daily hotels</li>
<li><strong>Challenge Reasonableness Disputes</strong> — If the insurer says your housing is too expensive, provide local market rate evidence</li>
<li><strong>Fight Early Cutoffs</strong> — Document why your home remains uninhabitable if coverage is terminated early</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<div style="max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">
<div class="tool-card">
<h3>How much can I spend on temporary housing?</h3>
<p>You can spend what's "reasonable and comparable" to your home. If you live in a $2,000/month home, a $2,000/month rental is reasonable. A $5,000/month luxury apartment may not be.</p>
</div>

<div class="tool-card">
<h3>Can I stay in a hotel long-term?</h3>
<p>Yes, but extended stay hotels or short-term rentals are often more cost-effective and comfortable for long-term displacement.</p>
</div>

<div class="tool-card">
<h3>What if I stay with family?</h3>
<p>You can only claim actual expenses. If you pay family for accommodations, that may be covered. But you can't claim expenses you're not incurring.</p>
</div>

<div class="tool-card">
<h3>Does insurance pay my temporary housing directly?</h3>
<p>Policies vary. Some insurers pay hotels directly; others reimburse you after you pay. Clarify payment procedures with your insurer upfront.</p>
</div>

<div class="tool-card">
<h3>What if temporary housing costs exceed my coverage limit?</h3>
<p>You're responsible for costs above your limit. This is why choosing cost-effective housing and tracking spending is important.</p>
