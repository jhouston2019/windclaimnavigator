# Core Functional Tools Design Update Summary

**Date:** January 6, 2026  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Problem Identified

The Core Functional Tools section in the Resource Center was using a flat, list-based design that was inconsistent with the modern card-based design system used throughout the rest of the site.

### Before:
- Simple unordered list (`<ul>` with `<li>` elements)
- Basic text links with no visual hierarchy
- No descriptions or context for each tool
- Flat, non-interactive appearance
- Inconsistent with resource center design language

## Solution Implemented

Transformed the Core Functional Tools section to use the standardized `resources-tool-card` design system.

### After:
- **Modern card-based grid layout** (3-column responsive grid)
- **Rich card components** with:
  - Tool name as h3 heading
  - Descriptive paragraph explaining each tool's purpose
  - Visual "Open Tool →" call-to-action
- **Consistent styling** matching resource center standards:
  - Background: #F0F4FA (light blue)
  - Border-radius: 16px
  - Padding: 24px
  - Box-shadow: 0 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.04)
  - Hover effects: translateY(-2px) with enhanced shadow
- **Responsive design**:
  - Desktop: 3 columns
  - Tablet (≤1024px): 2 columns
  - Mobile (≤768px): 1 column

    <p>Tool description</p>
    <span class="resources-card-cta">Open Tool →</span>
  </a>
