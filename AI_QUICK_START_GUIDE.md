## 💡 Example Conversations

### ALE Tracker Tool
**You:** "Are restaurant meals covered under ALE?"

**AI:** "Yes, restaurant meals are typically covered under Additional Living Expenses (ALE) when you're displaced from your home due to a covered loss. However, there are important considerations:

**Coverage Details:**
- ALE covers the **additional cost** of meals beyond your normal food expenses
- You should track your typical monthly food budget for comparison
- Keep all receipts with dates, locations, and amounts

**Reasonableness Standard:**
- Meals must be reasonable in cost
- Excessive or luxury dining may be questioned
- Document why you couldn't prepare meals yourself

**Documentation Tips:**
- Save all receipts
- Note the reason for each meal (displaced, no kitchen access, etc.)
- Track both restaurant and grocery expenses
- Compare to your normal food costs

**Next Steps:**
1. Calculate your typical monthly food budget
2. Keep detailed receipts for all meals
3. Document your displacement circumstances
4. Submit expenses with clear explanations"

### Carrier Request Logger Tool
**You:** "The carrier is asking for 10 years of tax returns. Do I have to provide this?"

**AI:** "No, a request for 10 years of tax returns is likely **overreaching** and may not be legitimate. Here's what you need to know:

**Legitimacy Analysis:**
- Tax returns are only relevant if income loss is claimed
- Even then, 2-3 years is typically sufficient
- 10 years is excessive and likely a fishing expedition

**Your Rights:**
- You can object to overreaching requests
- Provide only what's reasonably related to your claim
- Request clarification on why this information is needed

**Appropriate Response:**
1. Ask the carrier to explain the specific relevance
2. Offer to provide 2-3 years if income loss is claimed
3. Object to the excessive scope in writing
4. Consult with an attorney if the carrier insists

**Red Flags:**
- This may be a delay tactic
- Could indicate bad faith claim handling
- Document this request carefully

**Recommended Action:**
Send a written response objecting to the scope and requesting clarification on the specific relevance to your property damage claim."
