# Deploy Protected Documents to GitHub Repository

## Current Status
✅ Protected documents are ready for GitHub deployment
📁 English: 122 protected PDFs
📁 Spanish: 125 protected PDFs
🔒 Security: Password protection, watermarks, restrictions

## The Challenge
The documents are stored in the GitHub repository at:
- https://github.com/jhouston2019/Claim Navigator
- They are served from: https://Claim Navigator.com/docs/

## Deployment Strategy

### Option 1: Manual GitHub Upload (Recommended)
1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/jhouston2019/Claim Navigator
2. Navigate to the docs/ directory (or wherever the original documents are stored)
3. For each protected document:
   - Click on the file
   - Click "Edit" (pencil icon)
   - Upload the protected version
   - Commit the changes
4. This will trigger automatic Netlify deployment

### Option 2: GitHub CLI (If you have it installed)
1. Install GitHub CLI: https://cli.github.com/
2. Login: gh auth login
3. Clone the repository locally
4. Copy protected documents to the docs directory
5. Commit and push: git add . && git commit -m "Deploy protected documents" && git push

### Option 3: Git Commands (If you have Git access)
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/jhouston2019/Claim Navigator.git
2. Copy protected documents to the docs directory
3. Commit and push: git add . && git commit -m "Deploy protected documents" && git push

## File Structure for GitHub
```
docs/
├── en/          # English documents (122 files)
└── es/          # Spanish documents (125 files)
```

## Security Features Applied
- Password: Claim Navigator2025
- Watermark: "Claim Navigator - Protected Document"
- Restrictions: No printing, copying, or modification
- Encryption: 128-bit AES

## Verification
After deployment, verify that:
1. Documents are accessible at https://Claim Navigator.com/docs/
2. Documents require password to open
3. Watermark appears at bottom of each page
4. Printing and copying are disabled

## Important Notes
- This will replace ALL original documents with protected versions
- The original documents are safely backed up in backup_original/
- Netlify will automatically deploy the changes
- The process may take several minutes to complete

## Next Steps
1. Choose your preferred deployment method
2. Upload the protected documents to GitHub
3. Wait for Netlify to automatically deploy
4. Test access in the response center
5. Verify security features are working
