## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
User → Tool Page → AI Chat Interface → Netlify Function → OpenAI API → Response
                                    ↓
                            Claim Context (localStorage)
```

### Context Injection
Each AI request includes:
- Tool ID and configuration
- User message
- Tool-specific system prompt
- Claim context (claim number, loss date, carrier, etc.)
- Completed steps
- Professional guidelines

### Storage
- Tool data saved to localStorage: `tool_{toolId}_data`
- Claim context from existing storage system
- Chat history maintained in session (not persisted)
