# Understanding Proof of Loss

A **Proof of Loss** is one of the most critical documents in your insurance claim process. Understanding what it is and how to complete it correctly can make the difference between a smooth claim process and delays or denials.

## What is a Proof of Loss?

A Proof of Loss is a sworn statement that details:
- The amount you're claiming
- The date and cause of the loss
- A description of damaged or lost property
- Documentation supporting your claim

Most insurance policies require you to submit a Proof of Loss within a specified timeframe—typically 60 days after the loss, but this varies by state and policy.

## Key Elements of a Proof of Loss

Your Proof of Loss should include:

1. **Complete Inventory**: List all damaged or lost items with descriptions
2. **Valuation**: Provide replacement cost or actual cash value for each item
3. **Supporting Documentation**: Include receipts, photos, estimates, and appraisals
4. **Sworn Statement**: Sign under penalty of perjury that the information is true

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Missing Deadlines**: Submit your Proof of Loss within the required timeframe
- **Incomplete Information**: Ensure all items are listed with detailed descriptions
- **Lack of Documentation**: Provide receipts, photos, and estimates for all claimed items
- **Incorrect Valuations**: Use replacement cost for structures, actual cash value for contents
