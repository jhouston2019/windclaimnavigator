## 🎯 What Is This?

The **Claim Success Protocol™** is a UX re-architecture of Claim Navigator that transforms the user experience from **browsing-based** to **linear, enforced, outcome-driven**.

### The Problem (Before)
- Users logged in to a dashboard with many tool cards
- Users could explore tools in any order
- No clear "next step" guidance
- Users wandered and got lost
- Low completion rates
- Weak claims due to missed steps

### The Solution (After)
- Users log in directly to **Step 1 of 7**
- Users follow a **proven sequence**
- Clear "what, why, and how" at every step
- Users **cannot skip ahead**
- High completion rates expected
- **Stronger claims** with complete documentation

## 🏗️ The 7 Steps

1. **Understanding Your Policy** - Coverage, limits, deadlines
2. **Documenting Your Loss** - Photos, inventory, receipts
3. **Communicating Effectively** - Professional communication
4. **Validating the Estimate** - Challenge insurer's estimate
5. **Submitting Your Claim** - Complete submission
6. **Negotiating Your Settlement** - Strategic negotiation
7. **Finalizing Your Claim** - Review and archive

Each step:
- ✅ Explains what to do and why it matters
- ✅ Provides step-specific tools (gated)
- ✅ Requires completion criteria (checkboxes)
- ✅ Shows consequence language (enforcement)
- ✅ Saves progress automatically
